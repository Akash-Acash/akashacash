ACADEMICS .</br>
Concentrated on academics in the area of pure science and computer science then moved on to </br>
application level during undergrad years in the domain of mechanical engineering, concentrated on</br> 
the mathematics part more specifically Calculus and Statistics. Calculations involving velocity and </br>
accelerations of linked mechanisms were also an area of interest</br>

WORK EXPERIENCE</br>
- Worked in TCS BFSI domain (TCS BaNCS) as System developer for a Major Bank in the Middle </br>
East.</br>
- COBOL programming: writing codes in COBOL to take data from different tables according to </br>
requirements and writing to .csv files. Banking database, logic and conversion rates were delt with </br>
here. Coding was done in Vim/Vi editor in Linux terminal, PuTTY.</br>
- SQL loading: Linux backend, Upload data through Linux terminal using SQL*Loader, for a brief </br>
time making .ctl & .sql files for this purpose.</br>
- REST API creation and deployment: assisting with converting xml files to json, Localhost it on </br>
Swagger UI and then error resolutions if needed before transferring it over to QA region for testing </br>
team. Deployment of new .class files and updated .EAR file over WinSCP.</br>
- UNIX and Windows shell scripting for task automation: Shell script to automate bringing up of </br>
down services and pointing of services were made for Linux. Creating .bat (batch) files to automate </br>
workflow for assigned tasks was made for Windows.</br>
- Selenium Automation: import and use of selenium tools to automate regression testing. Automation </br>
of mandatory field input in Bank teller screen. Xpath, html and excel for data inputs were delt with.</br>
- JAVA programming: Programming as well as debugging in java was followed throughout the course </br>
of REST API creation and Selenium Automation, Eclipse IDE.</br>
- Worked on automating testing script for the following modules- Corporate loan, Escrow account, </br>
Cheque Discount Loan, Customer creation, Non-Performing Assets conversion.</br>

OTHER .</br>
- Cooling system based on Peltier, integrated with sensors, actuators, and a graphic terminal for </br>
displaying the statistics in graphical formal. Microcontroller programming were also involved for the </br>
sequence of operation part, (College final year project).</br>
- Quantum computing – entangled two qubits, using IBM Q’s ibmq_16_melbourne (14 qubit system) </br>
quantum computer, with the help of qiskit and some resources from Microsoft Research channel, done </br>
out of curiosity. (2018 end)</br>
- Build and calibrated a quadcopter working on basic level kk board.</br>
- Strobe light, colour mixing using RGB led, obstacle detection bot and various other microcontrollerbased hobby projects.</br>
- Modelling works in Solidworks and Blender.</br>
- Presented the idea of an alternate fuel-based drone – got selected for the second round of Kerala start </br>
up mission, Alternate fuel being H2-O2 fuel cell for its light weight and high power to weight ratio, </br>
Identified the current market players as HES energy system and intelligent energy. (2018)</br>
- Was selected to attend World Space Week at liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala. </br>
(2017)</br>
- Build an image classifier using data sets and function/code from Kaggle.com. Tensor flow, keras </br>
libraries, Python and Spyder IDE were dealt with here.</br>
- Avid follower of Quantum computing, Robotics, Crisper cas9, Gartner Reports, Technological </br>
Singularity, Nanotech, Ray Kurzweil among many others.</br>

SPORTS .</br>
Tennis: Received Academy level training for 2+ years, attended three tournaments till date.</br>
Occasionally plays Football.</br>

AHEAD .</br>
Although I have scratched the surface layer of many incoherent areas out of curiosity, given the </br>
chance and opportunity I’d like to shift my focus on to particular areas where I can study deep and </br>
contribute better, namely advancement of technology in the areas of making human life and health </br>
better, longevity and happiness index.</br>

SKILLS .</br>
SOLIDWORKS – ANSYS – Java - IBM Q – Blender - Arduino IDE - Shell Scripting – Calculus -</br>
Adobe Photoshop - Pivot Table – Notepad++ - Firebug – Beyond Compare - please refer</br>
